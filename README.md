# Weather 

Sample weather forecast app using the MVVM architectural pattern. This app is going to do things like getting weather data from an API using Retrofit and Gson, caching this data in an SQLite database using Room library, handling asynchronous code using Kotlin's coroutines, concentrating data operations in a Repository class, injecting dependencies using Kodein library, getting the user's location and more.
